The insight screen shows a preview of telemetry data streamed from bluetooth device (either real or simulated) or from one of the platform provider (Apple Health, Google Fit).

Data shown can be controlled using side menu that can be activated by tapping on "Sync options" or on the 3-dots icon on top-right in header bar.

Unselecting an item also stops telemetry delivery to IoT Central, if connected, for it.
